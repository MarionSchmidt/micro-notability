A '''wearable computer''' is a small [[portable computer]] that is designed to be worn on the body during use. In this wearable computers differ from [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], which are designed for hand-held use. Wearable computers are usually either integrated into the user's [[clothing]] or can be attached to the body through some other means, like a wristband. They may also be integrated into everyday objects that are constantly worn on the body, like a [[wrist]] [[watch]] or a hands-free [[cell phone]].

The aim of wearable computing [[scientific community|community]] is to develop new [[user interface]]s that mediate (augment, deliberately diminish, or otherwise modify) non-computer activities, without interfering with the user's everyday tasks. The design of wearable computers is still a topic of [[research]], and a variety of user interfaces are being proposed.  

The commercialization of wearable computing has been led by companies such as [[Xybernaut]], [[HandyKey]], and [[ViA]].  Publicly-traded Xybernaut has forged alliances with companies such as [[IBM]] and [[Sony]] in order to make wearable computing widely available. In 1998 [[Seiko]] marketed the [[Ruputer]], a computer in a (fairly large) wristwatch, to mediocre returns. In 2001 [[IBM]] developed and publicly displayed two prototypes for a wristwatch computer running Linux, but the product never came to market. In 2002 [[Fossil]] announced the Fossil WristPDA, which ran the [[PalmOS]]. Its release date was set for summer of 2003, but was delayed several times and eventually pushed back indefinitely.

Some wearable computers use [[Keyer|keyers]] (keyswitches mounted to a grip, rather than to a board, as with a keyboard) and trackballs as input devices, but many try to use more intuitive means of input like [[gesture recongnition|gesture]], [[speech recognition]] or [[context awareness]]. The output may be presented through displays, lights, sound or even [[haptic]] interfaces. Some [[Mediated reality|mediated reality]] ([[augmented reality|augmented]], diminished, or otherwise modified reality) systems can also be considered wearable computers.

Wearable computers of the 1970s were typically large, sometimes even requiring the user to wear a backpack. In the 1980s these systems were miniaturized to smart clothes (computer jackets) and eyeglasses, where the components were mounted outside the eyeglasses.  In the 1990s covert or normal-looking systems were developed that had the appearance of ordinary clothing and eyeglasses, by way of an underwearable computer (worn under a shirt) and EyeTap eyeglasses.  In 1998, a fully functional wristwatch computer system was designed and built, and later featured on the cover of Linux Journal.

[[Steve Mann]]'s [[wearcomp]] has other properties such as '''operational constancy''' (the property that the computer is always on and ready for use).

The [[United States Army]] plans to issue 10,000 wearable computers to its combat troops in the next few years.  They have approved a robust design that will supposedly be immune to weather, temperature, and vibration extremes.  It consists of two belt-hung modules for power and processing, and an interface integrated with the regular combat helmet.
