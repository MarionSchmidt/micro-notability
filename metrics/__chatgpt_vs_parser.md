### **Comparison Results:**

#### Matches:

_(None. No identical occurrence counts match between the two lists.)_

#### Discrepancies:

- **Joseph Fourier**:

  - ChatGPT-4o List: 4 occurrences
  - Parser List: 211 occurrences

- **Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet**:

  - ChatGPT-4o List: 1 occurrence
  - Parser List: 4 occurrences

- **All others with non-zero counts in the ChatGPT-4o List (Euler, d'Alembert, Bernoulli, Gauss, Lagrange, Laplace, Malus, Legendre, Riemann, Peter–Weyl theorem, Riemann–Lebesgue lemma, Kolmogorov, Carleson, Klein)** are not referenced at all in the Parser List.

- **Additional Entries Only in Parser List**:

### **Summary:**

- **Significant Increase**: Joseph Fourier is massively over-represented in the second list compared to the first (211 vs. 4).
- **Moderate Increase**: Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet also shows more occurrences in the second list (4 vs. 1).
- **Missing References**: Every other named mathematician or theorem with non-zero counts in the first list does not appear in the second list.
- **Newly Identified Names**: The second list introduces several entities (Jean, Fetter Walecka, Papula, Shmaliy, by Alexander Freeman) not present in the original list.

### **Key Observations:**

- The second list heavily focuses on Fourier-related references.
- Most other mathematicians and theorems mentioned in the first list are absent in the second.
- New names and references appear only in the second list, indicating additional, unrelated content not aligned with the first list’s focus.
